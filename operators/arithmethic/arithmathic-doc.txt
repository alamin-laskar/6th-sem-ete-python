Python Arithmetic Operations Program


Overview:

    This program performs various arithmetic operations on two numbers entered by the user. It includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulus, and exponentiation.

    The program consists of two functions:

    operator(a, b) – Performs and displays the arithmetic operations.
    call() – Takes user input and calls the operator() function.

Code Explanation
1. Function: operator(a, b)
This function takes two numbers (a and b) as input parameters and performs the following arithmetic operations:

Addition (+) → Adds a and b.
Subtraction (-) → Subtracts b from a.
Multiplication (*) → Multiplies a and b.
Division (/) → Divides a by b, resulting in a floating-point number.
Floor Division (//) → Divides a by b and rounds down to the nearest integer.
Modulus (%) → Returns the remainder when a is divided by b.
Exponentiation (**) → Raises a to the power of b.

2. Function: call()
Takes user input:
Prompts the user to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).
Converts the inputs to integers.
Calls the operator() function with the user-provided values.

3. Calling the call() Function
At the end of the script, call() is executed, ensuring that the program runs when executed.

Code Explanation
1. Function: operator(a, b)
This function is intended to take two input values (a and b); however, it overwrites them with True and False, making user inputs ineffective. To use actual inputs, we should remove a, b = True, False.

It demonstrates three logical operators:

Logical AND (and) → Returns True if both operands are True, otherwise False.
Logical OR (or) → Returns True if at least one operand is True.
Logical NOT (not) → Negates the Boolean value (converts True to False and vice versa).


2. Function: call()
Prompts the user to enter two integers.
Converts input values to Boolean (0 is False, nonzero values are True).
Calls operator(a, b) with Boolean-converted values.

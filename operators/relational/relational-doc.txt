Equal to (==) → Returns True if x is equal to y.
Not equal to (!=) → Returns True if x is not equal to y.
Greater than (>) → Returns True if x is greater than y.
Less than (<) → Returns True if x is less than y.
Greater than or equal to (>=) → Returns True if x is greater than or equal to y.
Less than or equal to (<=) → Returns True if x is less than or equal to y.

2. Function: call()
